# Session Log 003: Execution Planning Phase

**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Participants**: Developer, Claude
**Phase**: Execution Planning

## Objective
Review the initial plan, clarify the interactive nature of CLI Patterns, and establish the technical approach for building an interactive terminal UI.

## Context Discovery

### Initial Misunderstanding
The PRD and initial documentation assumed CLI Patterns would be a traditional command-line tool using Click or Typer for one-shot command execution. However, the developer clarified that CLI Patterns is intended to be an **interactive terminal application** that users launch and operate within.

**Developer Quote**: "I intend for this to be interactive - i'm not looking for it to be a one shot usage - it's a thing you launch, then operate within"

This fundamental clarification changed the technical approach significantly.

## Framework Evaluation

### Frameworks Considered

#### 1. Click/Typer (Not Suitable)
- **Purpose**: One-shot command execution
- **Why not suitable**: Designed for traditional CLI args parsing, not interactive shells
- **Example**: `mycli --option value command`

#### 2. cmd/cmd2 (Basic)
- **Purpose**: Simple interactive command loops
- **Pros**: Built into Python (cmd), simple to use
- **Cons**: Limited UI capabilities, basic interaction model

#### 3. Rich/Textual (Too Complex for MVP)
- **Purpose**: Full TUI applications with complex layouts
- **Pros**: Beautiful, modern, powerful
- **Cons**: Overly complex for MVP, steep learning curve

#### 4. prompt_toolkit (Selected)
- **Purpose**: Building interactive terminal applications
- **Pros**:
  - Purpose-built for interactive shells
  - Rich interactions (menus, completions, multi-line)
  - Async support aligns with execution model
  - Powers IPython, pgcli, and other major tools
  - Flexible and extensible
- **Cons**: Additional dependency, learning curve

## Decision: prompt_toolkit

### Rationale
prompt_toolkit was selected because it:
1. **Aligns with requirements**: Interactive, stateful navigation within a session
2. **Proven technology**: Powers major interactive Python tools
3. **Async native**: Works with our async execution model
4. **Rich features**: Completions, history, menus out of the box
5. **Fits the protocol**: Natural implementation of `UIRenderer` protocol

### Implementation Vision

Users will interact with CLI Patterns like this:

```bash
# Launch the wizard
$ cli-patterns my-wizard

# Enter interactive mode
Welcome to MyWizard v1.0.0
Type 'help' for commands, 'quit' to exit

wizard[main]> list actions
Available actions:
  1. setup - Setup environment
  2. config - Configure database
  3. test - Run tests

wizard[main]> run setup
► Executing: Setup environment...
✓ Environment configured successfully

wizard[main]> navigate config
→ Entering branch: configuration

wizard[config]> back
← Returning to: main

wizard[main]> quit
Goodbye!
```

## Architectural Impact

### New ADR Created
**ADR-006: Interactive Terminal UI with prompt_toolkit**
- Documents the decision to use prompt_toolkit
- Defines the interactive session model
- Shows implementation examples
- Maintains protocol boundary for future UI types

### PRD Updates (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)

#### Key Changes:
1. **Executive Summary**: Clarified as "interactive wizard-based terminal application framework"
2. **Vision**: Added "Users launch into an interactive shell"
3. **Goals**: Added "Interactive Experience" as primary goal
4. **Features**: Enhanced "Interactive Wizard Navigation" with shell features
5. **User Stories**: Updated to reflect interactive experience
6. **Dependencies**: Replaced Click/Typer with prompt_toolkit
7. **Examples**: Added interactive session example

#### New Sections:
- Example interactive session showing typical user flow
- Interactive commands and navigation patterns
- Rich prompt with branch context

## Implementation Plan Updates

### Phase 4: Interactive Shell (Revised)
1. ~~Click/Typer integration~~ → prompt_toolkit integration
2. Command parsing and routing
3. Interactive navigation implementation
4. Help system
5. Basic error handling

### New Considerations
- Command history persistence
- Tab completion for commands
- Contextual prompts showing current branch
- Rich formatting for output
- Interactive menus and selections

## Design Principles Reinforced

The interactive nature actually **strengthens** our design principles:

1. **Sophisticated Simplicity**: Complex interactions, simple mental model
2. **Stateless Default**: Each session starts fresh, state within session
3. **Protocol Boundaries**: UIRenderer protocol perfect for terminal UI
4. **Type Safety**: All interactions remain fully typed

## Technical Approach

### Core Interactive Loop
```python
class InteractiveWizardShell:
    def __init__(self, wizard: WizardConfig):
        self.wizard = wizard
        self.session = PromptSession()
        self.state = SessionState()
        self.current_branch = wizard.entry_branch

    async def run(self):
        """Main interactive loop."""
        while True:
            try:
                # Show prompt with branch context
                command = await self.session.prompt_async(
                    f"wizard[{self.current_branch}]> ",
                    completer=self.get_completer()
                )

                # Parse and execute command
                await self.execute_command(command)

            except (EOFError, KeyboardInterrupt):
                break
```

### Command Structure
- `list [actions|menus|options]` - Show available items
- `run <action>` - Execute an action
- `navigate <branch>` - Go to a branch
- `back` - Return to previous branch
- `show state` - Display current state
- `help [command]` - Get help
- `quit` - Exit the wizard

## Next Steps

With the interactive nature clarified and documented:

1. **Implement core types** - No change needed, already designed well
2. **Build prompt_toolkit UI** - Primary UI implementation
3. **Create command parser** - Parse interactive commands
4. **Implement navigation** - Branch traversal with history
5. **Add rich formatting** - Colors, boxes, progress indicators

## Lessons Learned

1. **Clarify interaction model early** - Interactive vs one-shot is fundamental
2. **Protocol design pays off** - UIRenderer protocol already supports this
3. **Requirements drive architecture** - Interactive need changed tool choice
4. **Documentation prevents confusion** - ADR-006 prevents future misunderstanding

## Outcomes

### Deliverables
1. **ADR-006**: Interactive Terminal UI decision record
2. **PRD v1.1.0**: Updated with interactive focus
3. **Clear vision**: Interactive wizard shell, not traditional CLI
4. **Technical path**: prompt_toolkit as UI framework

### Architecture Validation
The existing architecture (protocols, types, execution model) works perfectly with the interactive approach. No fundamental changes needed, just clarity on the UI implementation.

**End of Execution Planning Phase**

The project is now ready for implementation with a clear understanding that CLI Patterns is an interactive terminal application where users navigate wizards in a rich, stateful shell environment.
