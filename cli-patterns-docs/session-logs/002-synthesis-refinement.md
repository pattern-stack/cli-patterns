# Session Log 002: Synthesis and Refinement Phase

**Date**: 2024-01-18
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Participants**: Developer, Claude
**Phase**: Synthesis/Refinement

## Objective
Combine the original CLI Patterns specification with Pattern Stack context to create an aligned, refined architecture that maintains sophistication while ensuring simplicity.

## Starting Point
**Original Spec**: `.claude/specs/cli-pattern-plan.md`
- Fully typed wizard-based CLI system
- Strong emphasis on type safety with MyPy strict mode
- Discriminated unions for actions and options
- State management with optional persistence
- Clear protocol boundaries

## Synthesis Process

### 1. Architecture Alignment

**Original Proposal** (Claude):
```
cli_patterns/
├── core/           # Registry, router, context detection
├── patterns/       # Command patterns
├── adapters/       # Project adapters
├── commands/       # Built-in commands
├── ui/            # UI components
└── config/        # Configuration
```

**Refined Structure** (Aligned with Developer's Vision):
```
cli_patterns/
├── core/          # Type definitions from spec
├── definitions/   # Wizard loading (YAML + Python)
├── execution/     # Runtime engine
└── cli/          # Entry point only
```

**Key Changes**:
- Removed "projects" concept - keeping it stateless and simple
- Removed UI layer - protocols only for v1
- Focused on wizard execution rather than command routing
- Simplified to match the spec's sophistication with simplicity

### 2. Key Refinements

#### 2.1 Hybrid Definition System
**Developer Input**: "Both. YAML/JSON for simple bash operations... complex projects can use code with decorators"

**Synthesis**:
- Created clear separation between simple (YAML) and complex (Python) definitions
- Both compile to same `WizardConfig` type
- Examples provided for both approaches
- Mirrors Pattern Stack's configuration + code pattern

#### 2.2 Stateless Execution
**Developer Input**: "didn't even consider projects at first - just stateless execution"

**Synthesis**:
- Removed project context complexity
- Made state memory-only by default
- Session persistence becomes optional
- Aligns with Pattern Stack's "start simple" philosophy

#### 2.3 Subprocess Execution
**Developer Input**: "For MVP just launch in the shell we're in... use subprocesses effectively"

**Synthesis**:
- Simple `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` implementation
- No complex shell management (tmux) for v1
- Matches Pattern Stack's existing subprocess usage
- Clean, proven pattern

#### 2.4 UI Abstraction
**Developer Input**: "Separate - we will have protocols... starting with Branch"

**Synthesis**:
- Created `UIRenderer` protocol operating at branch level
- Three key methods: render_branch, collect_options, show_menu
- No implementation in v1, just protocol
- Branch-level granularity matches wizard navigation model

## Integration Decisions

### What We Kept from Original Spec
1. **Complete type system** - All types, validators, models unchanged
2. **Discriminated unions** - For actions and options
3. **State management approach** - SessionState with observers
4. **Protocol definitions** - ActionExecutor, OptionCollector, etc.
5. **Validation philosophy** - Parse, compile, and runtime validation

### What We Added from Context
1. **Hybrid definitions** - YAML for simple, Python for complex
2. **Concrete subprocess executor** - Implementation pattern from Pattern Stack
3. **Branch-level UI protocol** - Clean abstraction boundary
4. **Stateless execution model** - Explicit run() vs run_with_session()
5. **Clear module organization** - Aligned with Pattern Stack structure

### What We Removed/Deferred
1. **Project context** - Not needed for v1
2. **Cross-project navigation** - Complexity for later
3. **UI implementation** - Protocols only
4. **Hooks system** - Not in v1
5. **Complex shell management** - Simple subprocess for now

## Design Principles Established

1. **Sophisticated Simplicity**: Complex type system, simple runtime
2. **Stateless Default**: Persistence is opt-in, not required
3. **Protocol Boundaries**: Clear interfaces between layers
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Support both declarative and programmatic
5. **Type Safety First**: Everything fully typed

## Validation Against Requirements

### Developer's Goals ✓
- "Intentionally lightweight" → Stateless, minimal dependencies
- "Heavily type protected" → Full MyPy strict mode
- "Start Python, rebuild in Rust" → Protocol-based design enables this
- "Sophisticated with simplicity" → Types are complex, runtime is simple

### Pattern Stack Alignment ✓
- Follows Atomic Architecture principles
- Uses established patterns (subprocess, configuration)
- Maintains type safety standards
- Clear separation of concerns

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Stateless by default** (ADR-001)
2. **Hybrid definition system** (ADR-002)
3. **Subprocess for shell execution** (ADR-003)
4. **Branch-level UI protocol** (ADR-004)
5. **Comprehensive type system** (ADR-005)

## Outcomes

### Deliverables Created
1. **PRD**: Complete product requirements document
2. **ADRs**: Five architectural decision records
3. **Architecture**: Refined module structure
4. **Examples**: Both YAML and Python wizard examples
5. **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach for building

### Design Artifacts

**Final Architecture**:
```python
# Hybrid definitions
wizard.yaml → WizardConfig ← @wizard decorator

# Stateless execution
WizardConfig → ExecutionEngine → SessionState (memory only)

# Protocol boundaries
ExecutionEngine → ActionExecutor (protocol)
              → OptionCollector (protocol)
              → UIRenderer (protocol)
              → StorageAdapter (protocol)
```

## Next Phase: Execution

With the refined design complete and documented, the next phase will be:
1. Implement core type system exactly as specified
2. Build YAML loader to validate types
3. Create subprocess executor
4. Develop Python decorator system
5. Build execution engine
6. Create CLI entry point

The design is now aligned with both the original vision and Pattern Stack principles, ready for implementation.
